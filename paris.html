	<p>Being the city of love, Paris attracts billions of tourists all year round. But I must say, despite the crowd, this city is absolutely beautiful. For students visiting from the UK, getting here is really simple - and pretty cheap (if you book your tickets early). You can even take a train straight from London to get here, and it takes only 2 hours.<br>
    <br>
    Besides the Eiffel Tower, Champs-Élysées and Arc de Triomphe, there are so much more in Paris that I enjoyed. Here I have listed the <strong>10 ESSENTIAL THINGS TO DO</strong> in Paris. These are the memories that I will miss forever, so I would love to share them here with you!
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>1. Capture the front view of Eiffel Tower from Trocadéro.</strong><br>
    <br><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4789/40713999022_e106eb217a_o.jpg" alt="Eiffel Tower from Trocadéro" class="img-fluid"><br>
    <br>
    The first thing I did on the first morning in Paris - take the Metro to Stop Trocadéro and instantly switch to tourist mode. The clear unobstructed view of Eiffel Tower from Trocadéro is absolutely breathtaking. I can still remember the feeling of finally witnessing this famous landmark for the very first time.  <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>2. Visit the Notre-Dame de Paris.</strong><br>
    <br><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/790/26071261067_e3aebebb55_b.jpg" alt="Notre Dame" class="img-fluid"><br>
    <br>
    The Notre-Dame Cathedral has a long construction history since the year 1163. Its architecture is a masterpiece. From what I remember, I was in awe for the whole visit and still am until today. This is a must-visit when you come to Paris. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>3. Have escargot at L'Escargot Montorgueil.</strong><br>
    <br><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4782/25923138377_0c3b9c407a_b.jpg" alt="Escargots" class="img-fluid"><br>
    <br>
    Anyone who visits Paris has to try escargots, so I followed my friend's recommendation to have them here. Luckily, this was one of the few restaurants that were open on Christmas Day. With the restaurant's good ambience, enjoying their traditional escargots with my closest friends made this special day even more special. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>4. Pastries at Au Petit Versailles du Marais.</strong><br>
    <br><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4778/38985148440_f338b31461_b.jpg" alt="Versailles du Marais pastries" class="img-fluid"><br>
    <br>
    This lovely boulangerie has a wide selections of pastries. Its croissant, pain au chocolat and chocolate eclair were absolutely tasty! Plus, the prices are cheap too. I will definitely come back here if I ever visit Paris again.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>5. Stroll around the streets in Montmarte.</strong><br>
    <br><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4788/40085952854_57bfdb5063_b.jpg" alt="Montmarte streets" class="img-fluid"><br>
    <br>
    Montmarte is most known for the white-domed Basilica of the Sacré-Cœur, but you should also take some time to walk on the streets deep inside the area. Many artists used to live and work here, so be sure to lose yourself in this unique and lovely Parisian village!<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>6. Duck confit, Steak Tartar and Roast Chicken at Cafe de l'empire.</strong><br>
    <br><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4783/25924302647_2e863737b4_b.jpg" alt="Cafe de l'empire" class="img-fluid"><br>
    <br>
    With so many tourists in Paris, finding somewhere cheap to eat is quite difficult. However, Cafe de l'empire serves the best dinner at the most affordable price! Their duck confit, steak tartar and roast chicken are my favourites. If you are on a budget but looking for good food, then this place is for you! <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>7. Visit Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle.</strong><br>
    <br><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4777/40753929672_f8089aaf19_b.jpg" alt="National Museum of Natural History Paris" class="img-fluid"><br>
    <br>
    This museum was one of the best natural history mesuems I have ever visited. The building is not huge, yet you will find yourself learning tons of natural history. Besides EU citizens, any students currently staying in the UK and EU are allowed to go in for free. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>8. Have Fallafels and Lamb Shawarma at L'As du Fallafel.</strong><br>
    <br><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4778/26926230058_dd32d33f05_b.jpg" alt="L'As du Fallafel" class="img-fluid"><br>
    <br>
    Not only traditional French food, Paris has really delicious Middle Eastern cuisine as well! L'As du Fallafel is popular in the Le Marais neighborhood. Portions are big so the food is really worth the price. Despite the long queue outside the restaurant, the food and service were superb! <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>9. Try Baba au Rhum and Baba Chantilly at STOHRER.</strong><br>
    <br><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4795/40088478304_f92f9cede5_b.jpg" alt="Stohrer" class="img-fluid"><br>
    <br>
    The Baba au Rhum is a brioche soaked in rum. When topped with Chantilly cream, it is called Baba Chantilly. Thanks to the rum, this dessert has a unique mixture of sweetness and alcoholic taste. Having this dessert with a cup of tea is a perfect combination for a le goûter (tea-time)!  <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>10. Walk along the Seine.</strong><br>
    <br><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4779/39901961755_f101f9e8ec_b.jpg" alt="Pont Louis-Philippe on Seine" class="img-fluid"><br>
    <br>
    Walking along the Seine at night while admiring the beautiful scenery of Paris is probably the most relaxing way to enjoy Paris. Enjoy the view of the lit up bridges across the river. You will feel that you are indeed, in the city of love.<br>
