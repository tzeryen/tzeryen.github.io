	<p>Looking for a vacation at the beach? Palma de Mallorca will bring the fun in the sun to you! It was the end of second year at university and exams had just finished. My friends and I packed our bags, and headed straight to this summer getaway!<br>
	  <br>
	  Famous for its beaches and watersports, this island in Spain attracts millions of tourists each year. Enjoying the summer weather and stress-free days in Palma was the best way to celebrate the end of exams for us. So here are the TOP 10 THINGS TO DO in Palma that I would love to share with you!
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  <strong>1. Stroll around the city.</strong><br>
   	 <br><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/809/25956472617_eaf5dff181_o.jpg" class="img-fluid"><br>
    <br>
    The beautiful architecture of the buildings in the city has left me captivated. Walk through the market squares. Take pictures of the La Seu Cathedral. You will be mesmerized with this beautiful town. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>2. Enjoy a slow train ride to Sóller.</strong><br>
    <br><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/783/26958323548_e8c10a2619_o.jpg" class="img-fluid"><br>
    <br>
    Take the vintage train (Tren de Sóller) from Plaza de España to the Sóller village and enjoy a magnificent scenery along the journey. Once you reach Sóller, walk around the village and be sure to try their famous freshly squeezed orange juice.  <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>3. Then head to Port de Sóller.</strong><br>
    <br><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4775/26958624628_6f84cbc8c9_o.jpg" class="img-fluid"><br>
    <br>
    There is a tram connecting Sóller village and Port de Sóller at the same station I got off at Sóller. Many seafood restaurants lie along the sandy beaches at Port de Sóller, with a spectacular view of the mountains and sea.   <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>4. Visit a little village called Valldemossa.</strong><br>
    <br><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4781/40787224272_2188cd67d6_o.jpg" class="img-fluid"><br>
    <br>
    Valldemossa is a little town filled with pretty stone houses on top of the Tramuntana mountains. It is about half an hour bus ride from Palma. My aim was to visit the Chopin museum at Valldemossa's Monastery. Sadly, it wasn't open during my visit, so make sure to do your research well of the opening times. Nonetheless, I was able to discover the perfect spot to capture the beauty of this lovely town!  <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>5. Enter Cuevas del Drach.</strong><br>
    <br><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/819/39936324775_c3f986b716_o.jpg" class="img-fluid"><br>
    <br>
    The Cuevas del Drach is located at the east coast of Majorca. The walk inside the cave has about 180 steps, though they are not steep. Upon reaching the Martel Lake, there will be a short classical concert performed by some musicians on a boat. You can also choose to experience a boat ride on the Martel Lake after the performance. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>6. Ride a bike along the coastline.</strong><br>
    <br><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/811/26961247828_d417bc44c3_o.jpg" class="img-fluid"><br>
    <br>
    This is a flat smooth cycling route that stretches from Can Barbera all the way east to S'Arenal. Just start anywhere you like along the front. Enjoy the refreshing sea breeze, and feel free to stop by any of the beaches along the way if you want some sunbathing. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>7. Hike up to Castell de Bellver and view Palma from the top.</strong><br>
    <br><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/812/40122296844_ff02e141fe_o.jpg" class="img-fluid"><br>
    <br>
    We could have taken a bus to the Castell de Bellver, but instead we went adventurous by hiking up 450 steps up to the castle. It was really satisfying after reaching the top. The view of the island from above is definitely worth the hike.  <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>8. Have Patatas Bravas at Bar España.</strong><br>
    <br><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4795/25959982807_0c0eaa57e2_o.jpg" class="img-fluid"><br>
    <br>
    Patatas bravas is a tapas dish of potato cubes served with spicy tomato sauce, and it is a must-try in Spain. The patatas bravas here at Bar España was so delicious that my friends and I finished them within seconds!  <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>9. Parasailing at Magaluf Beach.</strong><br>
    <br><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/813/39937053445_012f1da5cc_o.jpg" class="img-fluid"><br>
    <br>
    The HIGHLIGHT of our trip! We headed to Katmandu Theme Park in the morning, which is near the Magaluf beach. Though I don't recommend going to the theme park except if you are bringing children, you should go to Magaluf beach for some watersports. I had an amazing parasailing adventure here, and I highly recommend visitors to try! <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>10. Dig into a plate of Seafood Paella at CALIXTO.</strong><br>
    <br><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/822/40789842812_b7d25c72fe_b.jpg" class="img-fluid"><br>
    <br>
    Anyone visiting Spain has to eat Paella. At CALIXTO, my friends and I ordered a huge plate of seafood paella to share. The seafood brings a perfect flavour to the dish. Definitely worth the wait! <br>
